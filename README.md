# Universal Robot library in GO (WIP)
**This is in early development stage -- only basic parsing of packets**

This Go (golang) Library supports the connection to a Universal Robot as Secondary Monitor.

This is very much inspired by the python-urx library (last seen here https://github.com/SintefRaufossManufacturing/python-urx)


## Compatibility

Right now it's mostly developed using the URsim Simulator in version 3.5.x. There have been changes in the secondary protocol lately, so older version might not work.
